[pykale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale) is a ([pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)-based) Python package aimed at making it easier for people to access machine learning. An important target audience are clinicians and clinical researchers who have amenable data to analyse, but lack the time and expertise to apply machine learning approaches. The work is supported by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/innovator-awards-digital-technologies).

A key RSE involvement in the project to date was the development of a documented strategy to add automated testing to the package. We also advise on the use of version control and collaboration via GitHub, as well as static analysis, release mechanisms and packaging.

Lack of expertise and governance barriers to transferring data from clinical organisations can mean that adoption of machine learning is reduced. Machine learning has the potential to improve diagnosis, prognosis and selection of treatment, improving health and quality of life for patients. A key example is analysis of medical imaging data to identify unusual features that may be of clinical interest.
