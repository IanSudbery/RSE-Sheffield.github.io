To coincide with this year's online RSE conference, [SeptembRSE](https://septembrse.society-rse.org/registration/), LunchBytes will be "colocating" on Zoom as part of the conference programme. All are welcome whether or not you're attending the conference, or at The University of Sheffield, so tell your friends!

This month's topic will be a showdown between some of the different options for managing virtual environments when working with Python. Will `Conda` come out on top? Or will the favourite be `venv` or `Poetry`?

Python is one of the most popular languages for research computing and virtual environments are a valuable method for managing dependencies within a project and ensuring a reproducible environment. There are lots of options around for virtual environment management in Python, in this special LunchBytes we'll be exploring the pros and cons of some of them with help from members of the research software engineering community.
