**Save the date!**

Short talks on how University of Sheffield researchers and RSEs, and collaborators worldwide, are using [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) and other platforms to handle clinical research data. The clinical research we will focus on here relates gathering data on people (e.g. evaluating interventions) rather than more fundamental laboratory research.

- **REDCap features, setup and maintenance**  Anna Krystalli
- **Transcriptomic Responses for the Identification of Pathogens** Farah Shahi 
- **Using REDCap to capture the economic impact on households of seeking care for children sick with, or exposed to, tuberculosis in three sub-Saharan African countries** Nyasha Mafirakureva
- **Using REDCap alongside an existing Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system: Fitting in with existing processes and comparing functionality between systems** Richard Simmonds

This session will take place on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/zzp-cspi-pbj) and participants can join 15 minutes before the start of the session.

We also have a [Google Jam Board](https://jamboard.google.com/d/11UY6-HkAjMzG9RbxH8aE-7hjl4dD4mnFMW1XMxoQS94) where you can note down any questions or comments before or during the event.
