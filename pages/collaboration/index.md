The RSE team can collaborate with you to help improve your research software.
We have a pool of [expert staff](/contact/team) to ensure that you can deliver excellent research software engineering on your research projects (see [example projects](/collaboration/projects/) and [testimonials](/collaboration/testimonials/)).
Supporting the entire University, we have collaborators in every faculty and have supported researchers in a range of subject areas including engineering, mathematics, computer science, biology, linguistics, physics, chemistry and geography. 

Areas of expertise within the team include:

* code optimisation and performance
* reproducibility and embedding good software engineering practice with your project or team
* GPU computing and Deep Learning
* statistical analysis and data visualisation
* High Performance Computing for local/national/international/cloud systems
* general software development
* development of impact case studies
* consultancy
* training
* education delivery and support

Our list of specialist expertise is constantly changing and improving so
please [contact us](/contact) if you are unsure if we can support your research software needs or read more on [what we do](./activities).
   
### Why work with the RSE Team

The RSE Team allows you to get dedicated help for professional software engineers.
Recruitment of such skills is very difficult on research projects,
especially when you only require short term expertise.
UKRI (and most other UK and EU funding agencies) understand what an import part RSEs have on research and
would like to see that they are being offered sustainable careers with academia.
The RSE Team provides this through underwritten roles and by allowing RSEs to work to a unique job description.
If you want to deliver software engineering as part of your grant application then
there is a good chance that you will be required to demonstrate how this will be done sustainability.
The RSE Team is an excellent way to provide this evidence to your funders.

## Collaborative research software development

The aim of the RSE team is to provide staff to support software engineering for research.
This is aways done as a collaborative exercise.
In most cases where an RSE is required, the novel research is facilitated by software and the RSE rather than the development of software being novel in its own right.
	
If you wish to undertake a collaborative software engineering project where the focus is on *novel software engineering research* then
this can be provided by our director or academics associated with the RSE team.
As part of this you may also cost RSE time.
The RSE director for example, holds an academic position in the Department of Computer Science and
delivers collaborative research around novel high-performance computing.
