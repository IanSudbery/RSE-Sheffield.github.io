# Statement on free at point of use training

We are delighted to be able to make free at point of use training available to the research community, to enable better software and more open, reproducible research. However, **free at point of use training is not free**. The cost of a course can easily run to thousands of pounds, if preparation costs are taken into account.

**If you sign up for a course, please make sure you either attend or cancel your booking.** Bookings can be cancelled using <eventbrite.com> or, failing that, by emailing <rse@sheffield.ac.uk>.

Running courses that are not fully attended wastes our funding (which is provided by taxpayers, charities and students, amongst others) and reduces our collective capacity to improve research outputs and researcher experiences.

Failure to attend a booked course may result in you being reported to your department.
