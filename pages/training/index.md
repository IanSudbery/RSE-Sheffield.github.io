We sometimes run courses for free (see our [events page][events]). However, we usually need to seek funding from an organisation, department, research group, institute or doctoral training centre. The costs of running a course are our [staff time][service] plus venue and infrastructure costs. This allows us to customise or develop new training for specific audiences.  

We have recently run these courses:

- [Reproducible Research Data and Project Management in R](courses/ACCE.md)
- [Introduction to Deep Learning](courses/Intro_DL.md)
- [Contributing to Open Source Software](courses/Open_Source.md)
- [git & GitHub through GitKraken - from Zero to Hero!](courses/git_Hero.md)
- [Write better research software (in Python)](courses/good_soft.md)

If you're interested in us running similar courses for your learners, please contact <rse@sheffield.ac.uk>.

Our expertise for bespoke training development includes Python, R, MATLAB, Reproducible research, C and C++, git and GitHub, Linux shell, High Performance Computing, GPU Computing, Systems administration inc. Docker and Ansible.

### Carpentries

While we do not currently pay to be accredited to deliver Software Caprentries material, we can deliver material without accreditation. Some of our team are individually accredited instructors. Some examples of courses we might run are:

- [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
- [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
- [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
- [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)

It can be cost effective to use this great pre-existing material, as no staff time is needed to develop or customise material. Enquire via <rse@sheffield.ac.uk>.
