In this blog post we will introduce Git and talk about some terminologies related to Git and version control in general. We will also introduce some resources that might be helpful to read or watch.

If you are new to the Git world, you might hear some words that sound very similar and sometimes confusing. Below are a few definitions that might be useful;

## What is the difference between **Git** and **GitHub**?
Git is a version control system that you can use to manage your source code history.
What’s unique about Git is that it’s distributed. It allows you to have your own local repositories. You can work on your code without having access to the internet.
**GitHub**, **GitLab** and **Atlassian's BitBucket** are hosting services for Git repositories.
So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git and it is built on top of Git. Git is installed locally while GitHub is hosted on the cloud. 

**GitLab** is very similar to Github, however, it was initially designed with a built-in Continuous Integration (CI)/Continues Development (CD) tool. The Continuous Integration framework inside GitLab is ranked as one of the best tools out there, if not the best.
For having CI/CD in Github you needed 3rd party tools such as Jenkins, however, currently GitHub has a built-in CI/CD framework called **Github Actions**. Github Actions enable users to quickly automate tests (CI), and deploy (CD) code. If you are interested, very thorough explanation can be found [here](https://blog.codegiant.io/gitlab-vs-github-which-one-is-better-2020-d8ec7fb9542c).

**GitHub Pages** is a static hosting service that takes HTML, CSS and JavaScript files from a repository on GitHub. More information can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#about-github-pages).
